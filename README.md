flash-dirver-cmocka
===================

Example of using cmocka c test framework, and TDD

First install ccmocka from cmocka.org
You also need cmake and gcc

At the time of this writing, here is what I did
- Download the tarball
- Expand it into <some_dir>
- mkdir <some_dir>/build
- cd <some_dir>/build
cmake ..
make
make install

If you use eclipse, you may want to notice where it puts the .h files so you can tell eclipse.
